I opened my inbox this morning to find two emails sitting side by side.

The first: a LinkedIn connection request from someone whose company just announced an "AI-first transformation." The second: a calendar invite from a client asking if we could help because "our people are using AI, but we've never actually trained anyone."

The gap between ambition and capability has never been clearer.

New research from Salesforce and Morning Consult surveyed over 14,000 workers globally, including 1,100 Australians, and the findings should be a wake-up call for every SME leader. Only 41% of Australian workers believe their workplace is prepared for AI—below the 48% global average and miles behind countries like India (83%) and Saudi Arabia (70%).

Let me put that another way: six out of ten Australian workers don't think their employer is ready for AI. And they're probably right.

## The gap isn't about technology—it's about training

Here's what the data tells us:

- 45% of Australian workers support more investment in AI, but they expect employers and government to lead the charge
- Only one in three workers expect their workplace to increase investment in AI learning in the next year
- Globally, nearly two-thirds of workers say they'd take AI training if governments offered financial support

Translation: your people want to learn. They know AI is coming. But they're waiting for you to show them how.

The problem? Most Australian SMEs fall into one of two camps: "we'll figure it out as we go" (ad hoc experimentation with no guardrails) or "we need a proper AI strategy first" (analysis paralysis while competitors move).

Both approaches leave a critical gap: your team doesn't know what good looks like.

## What happens when you don't train

I've seen this play out three ways:

**The Risk Creep:** Your finance manager pastes customer contracts into ChatGPT. Your service team shares internal client notes in public AI tools. No one told them not to—because no one trained them.

**The Productivity Theater:** People attend a lunch-and-learn about AI. Everyone gets excited. Three weeks later, adoption is zero because no one knows which tools are approved or how to use them.

**The Hero Bottleneck:** One enthusiastic person becomes "the AI person." They build good workflows. Then they leave—and all that knowledge walks out the door.

## What effective AI training looks like for SMEs

After running AI training programs with Australian SMEs over the past year, here's what actually works:

**Start with the work, not the technology.** Don't teach "what is AI." Teach "here's how we use AI to write better service emails" or "here's how finance uses AI for AR follow-ups."

**Train in layers, not all at once.** Executives get 60–90 mins on strategy and governance. Managers learn how to review AI outputs and coach teams. Teams get hands-on sessions on approved tools. Total time: 4–6 hours over a month, not a two-day course.

**Make it safe to experiment—on rails.** Give people a simple framework: pick a weekly task, try it with AI using approved tools, document the result, share it with your manager. Manager turns the good ones into SOPs.

**Track adoption, not attendance.** Measure % of team using approved tools weekly, number of workflows documented, and time saved on specific processes. If you're not tracking this, you won't know if training is landing.

## Why most SMEs don't train—and why they should anyway

I hear three objections constantly:

**"We don't have time."** You have time for the productivity loss from people guessing? Training can be six hours over four weeks.

**"AI is changing too fast—we'll wait."** AI won't settle. Train on foundations (prompting, data hygiene, tool governance) and iterate as tools evolve.

**"We can't afford it."** The real cost is not training. When your competitors are using AI to respond to customers faster and draft proposals in half the time—can you afford to let your team fall further behind?

## Start here: assess before you train

Before you design training, figure out where you are. Some people are power users. Others have never used a generative AI tool.

## Key takeaways

- 41% of Australian workers believe their workplace is prepared for AI—that's a failing grade
- Workers want training, but they expect employers to lead
- Effective training is role-specific, layered, and tied to real work
- You can't build an AI strategy without building AI skills

The skills gap is real, and it's widening. The SMEs that train now are building a 6–12 month capability advantage. If you want help designing a practical AI training program for your team, [let's talk](/contact).
