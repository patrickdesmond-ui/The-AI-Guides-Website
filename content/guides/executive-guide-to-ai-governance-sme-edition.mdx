## Why this matters

Most Australian SMEs sit in one of two camps: no AI policy at all (so people are nervous or go rogue), or an overcooked policy copied from an enterprise template (so no one uses AI). Good governance for an SME is short, clear, and designed to enable AI, not stop it.

This guide shows you the minimum viable AI governance setup.

## 1. Start with a one-page policy

Your AI policy should answer five things in plain English:

- **Purpose** — why you're using AI (productivity, quality, speed).
- **Approved tools** — which AI tools are OK right now.
- **Data rules** — what staff can/can't paste into AI tools.
- **Human-in-the-loop** — what must be checked by a person.
- **Incidents** — what to do if something goes wrong.

That's it. One page. Make it easy to read on mobile.

## 2. Use red / amber / green data rules

This is the simplest way to reduce risk without killing adoption.

**Red (never in public AI):** customer PII, salary/payroll, secrets, legal disputes, anything contractually sensitive.

**Amber (only in approved tools):** internal docs, SOPs, proposals, financial summaries, product info.

**Green (OK):** public info, marketing copy, generic content.

Put examples under each colour using your language so staff recognise the data.

## 3. Require human review for "material" outputs

AI is great at first drafts, not final judgment. Tell people:

- Customer-facing comms? Check.
- Board/exec papers? Check.
- Anything with numbers or obligations? Check.

Give them a 5-point QA checklist:
1. Is it factually correct?
2. Does it reference the right product/policy?
3. Is the tone right for our brand?
4. Are links/attachments correct?
5. Is the right person copied/assigned?

If it fails, fix or re-generate.

## 4. Keep a light audit trail

You don't need a SIEM and a GRC team. You do need to know what was generated, by whom, and for what.

Pick one of these:
- Ask teams to work in approved tools that already log history.
- Or add a simple "AI used" tickbox in your ticketing/CRM/SharePoint workflow.
- Or keep a shared "AI outputs" folder with date + owner.

That way, if there's a complaint or mistake, you can find it.

## 5. Check your vendors

Before rolling out a new AI tool, ask 5 questions:
1. Where is data stored?
2. Do you train your models on our data? Can we turn that off?
3. Do you support SSO / company logins?
4. Can admins see usage?
5. How do you handle takedown/correction?

If they can't answer quickly, don't use it across the business.

## 6. Set a review cadence

AI changes monthly. Your policy should too.

- Nominate an AI steward (could be ops, IT, or whoever's leading AI).
- Review the policy every quarter.
- Add/remove approved tools.
- Share 2–3 "good examples" of AI use from teams.

This normalises AI and keeps people inside the guardrails.

## 7. Where this gets you

With this SME-level governance:
- staff know what's allowed
- managers have something to point to
- you can move faster on strategy and training
- you reduce the "can I paste this?" noise

Now you can actually start rolling out AI-enabled workflows.
