Most Australian SMEs sit in one of two camps: no AI policy at all (so people are nervous or go rogue), or an overcooked policy copied from an enterprise template (so no one uses AI). Good governance for SMEs looks different.


## The SME Governance Challenge

Large enterprises have dedicated teams for AI governance. SMEs don't. You need governance that:

- Fits on a page
- Can be understood without training
- Enables responsible use (not just restricts)
- Can be maintained without a full-time role


## The Three-Tier Approach

I recommend a simple three-tier system for classifying AI use:


### Green: Go Ahead

Low-risk uses that are pre-approved:

- Using AI for brainstorming and ideation
- Drafting internal communications
- Summarising public documents
- General research and learning

**Key rule:** Don't input confidential or personal data.


### Amber: Proceed with Caution

Medium-risk uses that need care:

- Drafting external communications (human review required)
- Analysing business data (anonymised)
- Creating content for publication (disclosure required)
- Using AI with client-related information

**Key rule:** Human review before any external use.


### Red: Stop and Ask

High-risk uses that need approval:

- Any use involving personal data
- Legal, financial, or compliance documents
- Decision-making with significant impact
- New AI tools not yet approved

**Key rule:** Get explicit approval first.


## Your One-Page AI Policy

A practical AI policy for SMEs covers:


### 1. Approved Tools

List the specific AI tools employees can use. For example:

- ChatGPT (free version for Green uses only)
- Microsoft Copilot (for licensed users)
- [Your industry-specific tools]


### 2. Data Rules

Be explicit about what data can and cannot be entered:

- **Never:** Customer personal information, financial details, passwords
- **With care:** Business data (anonymised), internal processes
- **Okay:** Public information, general questions, hypothetical scenarios


### 3. Review Requirements

Specify when human review is required:

- Always before external communication
- Always for published content
- Always for decisions with financial or legal impact


### 4. Disclosure

When do you need to disclose AI use?

- **Internal team:** Not required for Green uses
- **Clients:** Required if AI significantly contributed to deliverables
- **Public:** Required for published content


### 5. Escalation

Make it clear who to ask when uncertain:

- Line manager for role-specific questions
- [Designated person] for policy questions
- Leadership for new tool requests


## Common Questions


### "Do we need to tell clients we use AI?"

Depends on the context. For routine efficiency (like drafting), generally no. For substantive work product, transparency builds trust.


### "What about employees using AI without telling us?"

This is already happening. Good governance acknowledges reality and provides safe channels rather than pretending prohibition works.


### "How often should we update our policy?"

Review quarterly. AI moves fast, and your policy should evolve.


## Getting Started

1. **Audit current use:** Find out what AI tools people are already using
2. **Classify your data:** What's sensitive, what's not
3. **Draft your policy:** Use the three-tier approach
4. **Communicate clearly:** Make sure everyone knows the rules
5. **Review regularly:** Build in quarterly check-ins
