I've split this AI news roundup into three sections so you can skim what matters and act on it.

- **Tech** covers the big platform moves that change the baseline
- **Tools** highlights features and products you could actually switch on inside the apps
- **Trends** looks at the broader patterns affecting Australian businesses


## Tech: Platform Moves


### OpenAI's Latest Updates

OpenAI continues to iterate rapidly on GPT-4, with new capabilities for code generation and analysis. For SMEs, this means better accuracy in technical tasks and more reliable outputs.

**What it means for you:** If you're using ChatGPT for coding, documentation, or technical writing, you should notice improved quality without changing anything.


### Microsoft's Enterprise Push

Microsoft is doubling down on Copilot for business, with new features specifically designed for smaller organisations. The focus is on reducing complexity and improving out-of-the-box value.

**What it means for you:** If you're on Microsoft 365, keep an eye on your admin centre for new Copilot features rolling out.


## Tools: What You Can Use Now


### Meeting Intelligence

Several platforms have upgraded their meeting AI capabilities. Notable improvements in Zoom, Teams, and Google Meet include:

- Better action item extraction
- Improved speaker attribution
- More accurate summaries


### Document Processing

AI-powered document processing tools are getting significantly better at handling Australian business documents, including tax forms, contracts, and compliance documentation.


## Trends: What's Coming


### AI Governance Pressure

Expect more pressure on businesses to demonstrate responsible AI use. This is a good time to establish basic AI policies if you haven't already.


### Skills Gap Widening

The gap between AI-ready organisations and those still figuring it out is growing. Early adopters are pulling ahead.
