Jarrod and I get asked all the time, "What can we actually do with AI right now — not six months from now?" So we started keeping a list of GenAI tasks that real teams in services, finance and ops can run this month with tools they already have. Nothing exotic, nothing that needs a data team, and all of it easy to wrap in your one-page policy.

Here are 10 of those quick wins. Pick two or three, try them with one team, then turn them into standard workflows.

## 1. Role-based prompt packs (any function)

Take the 3–5 most common tasks for a role — "respond to a customer," "summarise a meeting," "draft a variance note," "write an SOP step" — and have GenAI generate prompts plus a quick QA checklist. Store them in your intranet/SharePoint.

**Why it's a win:** you lift the whole team at once, not just the strongest prompter.

## 2. Executive/board narrative generator (finance/exec)

Feed in your monthly metrics and variance notes and ask GenAI for a 200–300 word executive summary with: headline, 3 drivers, risks, outlook.

**Why it's a win:** board/ELT get consistent narratives and finance gets time back.

## 3. Variance explainer (finance)

Paste the P&L excerpt or a table and ask: "Explain the top 3 variances vs budget and last month, with likely root causes and where to investigate."

**Why it's a win:** turns numbers into insight for non-finance leaders.

## 4. Issue/theme synthesiser (ops/projects/service)

Drop in a week of tickets/emails/issues and ask: "Group these by theme, count them, and suggest the top 3 fixes."

**Why it's a win:** leaders see patterns instead of noise.

## 5. Scenario compare (ops/finance)

Describe two or three options — supplier A vs B, delivery option 1 vs 2, in-house vs outsource — and ask GenAI to compare on cost, risk, time, and customer impact.

**Why it's a win:** managers get a structured way to decide without building a deck.

## 6. Customer/theme mining (service/CX)

Paste customer comments or NPS verbatims and ask: "What are the main themes, which ones look preventable, and what should we tell the team?"

**Why it's a win:** lets you fix the upstream issue, not just answer the ticket.

## 7. SOP optimiser (ops)

Give it an existing procedure and ask: "Simplify steps, reduce handoffs, and flag anything that could be automated or templated."

**Why it's a win:** improves the process itself, not just writes it nicely.

## 8. Procurement/commercial explainer (ops/finance)

Paste two supplier proposals and ask: "Highlight the differences in scope, SLAs, and commercials; flag anything that needs legal/exec review."

**Why it's a win:** faster, clearer procurement decisions.

## 9. Meeting decision-pack builder (exec/ops)

Feed in meeting notes + attachments and ask: "Create a decision pack: context, options with pros/cons, recommended action, owner."

**Why it's a win:** ELT can actually make the decision in the meeting.

## 10. Training/skills gap analyser (people/ops)

Paste role descriptions or a quick staff survey around competencies and ask: "Where are the gaps for AI-enabled work? Suggest 3 micro-trainings per role."

**Why it's a win:** turns "we should train people" into a concrete plan.

## Make it safe

- Tell people which tool to use (your approved list).
- Apply your red/amber/green data rules.
- Require human review for anything customer-facing or financial.
- Save the best prompts somewhere everyone can find them.

If you want help turning 2–3 of these into proper workflows for your team — with prompt kits, QA steps, and training — that's exactly what we do. [Contact us today](/contact).

Cheers,
Patrick
