A lot of AI conversations get stuck at "we should train people." That's true, but what most Australian SMEs actually need is a way to keep people learning as AI changes — without blowing up everyone's calendar. So I think about it less as "a course" and more as an AI capability system: a few things leaders do, a few things teams do, and a few things we measure.

Here's how I'd build it.

## 1. Start with a capability map, not a tool demo

Before we pick content, I like to answer one question: "What do we want our people to be able to do with AI, reliably?"

For most SMEs the list is short:
- Use approved AI tools safely
- Turn prompts into usable work (emails, summaries, docs)
- Improve a process with AI and show the benefit
- Know when to ask for help / escalate

That's your capability map. Training should point at those four, not at "everything AI can do."

## 2. Make AI a team sport

Individual heroes are nice, but they don't move the P&L. You want whole teams working the same way.

What works well is a 3-lane model:
- **Exec lane:** direction, policy, and "here are the 2–3 AI things we care about this quarter."
- **Manager lane:** standardise the prompts/workflows for their team and review AI outputs.
- **Team lane:** use the approved workflows, contribute improvements.

When we run executive training, this is basically what we're trying to set up — so the skills don't end with the ELT.

## 3. Layer the learning (light, then deeper)

Most people don't need a two-day AI course. They need several small, well-timed hits.

A simple sequence:
- **Kick-off (everyone):** 45–60 mins on what AI is, what's approved, and how to stay safe.
- **Role/functional sessions:** "AI for service," "AI for finance," "AI for ops." Real work, real examples.
- **Manager clinics:** 30–45 mins on how to review AI work, how to spot good prompts, how to coach.
- **Refreshes:** short updates when tools/policy change.

Nice thing: you can run all of this in 4–8 weeks without stopping the business.

## 4. Put innovation on rails

"Experiment!" is useless instruction. People need to know how.

Give them a dead-simple format:
1. Pick a task you do every week.
2. Try to do it with AI (using approved tools).
3. Capture the prompt and the "before vs after."
4. Share it in a common place.
5. Manager picks the good ones and turns them into SOPs.

That's how you get a culture of "we try things" without chaos.

## 5. Measure skills, not just attendance

If you only track "who turned up," you won't know if AI is actually landing.

Track things like:
- % of team using approved tools weekly
- Number of AI-enabled workflows documented
- Amount of time saved on a single process
- Number of improvements submitted by staff

Those tell you if skills are turning into behaviour.

## 6. Where The AI Guides fit

This is basically what our executive training is designed to do: give leaders the shared language and guardrails, then help you cascade it so managers and teams actually build the skills. We can map the 3-lane model to your org, write the one-pager policy, and design the short, role-based sessions so you don't have to invent all of this.

**Key idea:** AI skills shouldn't depend on one enthusiastic person. They should be part of how the business works — lightweight, repeatable, and tied to the work people already do.

If you want to set that up once and hand it to your managers, let's plan it together. [Contact us today](/contact).

Cheers,
Patrick
