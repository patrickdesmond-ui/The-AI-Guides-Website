Most of the SMEs I speak with are in the same position: they know AI is important, they've seen a few good demos, staff are already using tools quietly — but there's no single view of "what are we actually doing with AI?"

If that sounds familiar, here's what an AI strategy for SMEs actually needs to cover.

## What AI Strategy Isn't

Let's start by clearing up what AI strategy isn't:

- It's not a technology roadmap (though it might include one)
- It's not a list of every possible AI use case
- It's not a massive consulting document that sits on a shelf
- It's not a promise to "transform" everything

## What AI Strategy Actually Is

For an SME, AI strategy answers five practical questions:

### 1. Where can AI create value for us?

Not every AI capability matters for your business. A good strategy identifies the specific areas where AI can:

- Save significant time
- Improve quality of output
- Enable new capabilities
- Reduce risk or error

### 2. What should we do first?

With limited resources, sequencing matters. Prioritise based on:

- Impact (how much value?)
- Feasibility (can we actually do this?)
- Risk (what could go wrong?)
- Dependencies (what needs to happen first?)

### 3. How do we keep it safe?

AI governance isn't optional. Your strategy needs clear answers on:

- What data can AI tools access?
- Who approves new AI tools?
- How do we handle sensitive information?
- What review processes are required?

### 4. How do we get people ready?

Technology without capability is useless. Plan for:

- Leadership understanding
- Team training
- Ongoing support and learning
- Change management

### 5. How do we know it's working?

Define success upfront:

- What metrics matter?
- How will you track adoption?
- What does "good" look like?
- When will you review and adjust?

## The Minimum Viable AI Strategy

If you can only do one thing, create a one-page document that covers:

1. **Our AI position:** Where we are today
2. **Our priorities:** 2-3 focus areas for the next 90 days
3. **Our guardrails:** What's approved, what's not, what needs review
4. **Our next steps:** Specific actions with owners and dates

That's it. You can build from there.

## The Biggest Mistake

The biggest mistake I see? Waiting for the "perfect" strategy before doing anything. AI is moving fast. You need a strategy that's good enough to provide direction, flexible enough to adapt, and simple enough to actually use.
