Jarrod and I get asked all the time, "What can we actually do with AI right now—not six months from now?" So we started keeping a list of GenAI tasks that real teams in services, finance and ops are using today.

Here are ten that consistently deliver value with minimal setup.


## Services & Client Work


### 1. Proposal First Drafts

Use AI to generate initial proposal drafts from brief bullet points. You'll still need to refine and personalise, but starting from a structured draft saves significant time.

**Time saved:** 30-60 minutes per proposal


### 2. Meeting Preparation Summaries

Before client meetings, have AI summarise recent correspondence, past meeting notes, and project status into a one-page brief.

**Time saved:** 15-20 minutes per meeting


### 3. Client Communication Templates

Generate draft responses to common client queries. Build a library of templates that can be quickly customised.

**Time saved:** 10-15 minutes per response


## Finance & Administration


### 4. Report Narrative Generation

Take your monthly numbers and have AI draft the narrative explanation of variances, trends, and highlights.

**Time saved:** 1-2 hours per report


### 5. Policy Document Summaries

When reviewing compliance updates or regulatory changes, use AI to summarise key points and identify actions required.

**Time saved:** 45-60 minutes per document


### 6. Invoice Query Responses

Draft responses to invoice queries by providing the relevant details. AI can structure a professional, clear response quickly.

**Time saved:** 10-15 minutes per query


## Operations & Process


### 7. Process Documentation

Describe a process verbally or in rough notes, and have AI convert it into structured documentation with steps, responsibilities, and checkpoints.

**Time saved:** 2-3 hours per process


### 8. Training Material Drafts

Create first drafts of training guides and how-to documents from existing procedures or verbal explanations.

**Time saved:** 2-4 hours per guide


### 9. Email Triage and Categorisation

Use AI to help sort and prioritise incoming emails, flagging urgent items and suggesting response priorities.

**Time saved:** 30 minutes per day


### 10. FAQ Generation

From existing documentation, support tickets, or common questions, generate comprehensive FAQ documents.

**Time saved:** 3-4 hours per FAQ set


## Getting Started

The key to these quick wins is starting small:

1. **Pick one** that matches a task you do frequently
2. **Try it three times** with real work tasks
3. **Refine your prompts** based on what works
4. **Add another** once the first is working well
