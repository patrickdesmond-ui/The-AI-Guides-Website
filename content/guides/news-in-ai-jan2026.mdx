Happy New Year! Welcome to 2026. I've put together this month's AI news roundup in the same format as before: Tech covers the shifts shaping what's possible, Tools highlights features you can use now, and Trends distils what this means for Australian SMEs — including Canberra's new approach to AI governance.

## TECH

### 1) 2026 is the year AI gets practical — the hype is settling

The consensus from every major analyst is the same: 2026 is when AI moves from experimentation to deployment. TechCrunch calls it the shift "from hype to pragmatism." SAP, IBM, and Unisys all echo the same theme — organisations are moving past flashy demos toward repeatable, high-ROI use cases.

**So what?** If you've been waiting to see how AI plays out, the waiting period is over. The businesses pulling ahead now are the ones with governance in place, staff trained, and a handful of workflows already AI-enabled. Steady adoption beats one-off experiments.

### 2) AI is now "recession-proof" — but the gap between leaders and laggards is widening

KPMG's latest AI Pulse Survey found 67% of business leaders will maintain AI spending even if a recession hits in the next 12 months. AI isn't discretionary anymore — it's becoming core infrastructure.

But here's the catch: the same survey shows a growing divide. Some organisations stall after early pilots. Others are scaling fast and pulling ahead. The differentiator isn't budget — it's whether you're treating AI as a one-off project or building it into how your business operates.

**So what?** If you ran a Copilot or ChatGPT pilot last year, now's the time to ask: did it stick? If not, the issue is probably governance, training, or workflow integration — not the technology itself.

## TOOLS

### 1) The AI is already in your tools — standardise on what you have

A pattern worth noting: the core tools Australian SMEs already use — Xero, MYOB, Zendesk, HubSpot, Microsoft 365, Google Workspace — are all shipping their own AI assistants. These aren't third-party add-ons; they're native features controlled by admins.

The risk? Your team adopts a dozen different AI tools, each with its own data handling and security approach. The opportunity? Standardise on a few trusted, admin-controlled assistants and train teams on those.

**So what?** Audit what AI features are already available in your existing tools. Pick two or three to enable, train your team, and set clear data rules. This is faster — and safer — than adopting new standalone AI products.

### 2) Microsoft 365 price increase coming July 2026 — budget for it now

Microsoft announced expanded security and AI capabilities coming to M365 suites in 2026, along with a global price update effective July 1. If you're on Business Basic, Standard, Premium, or E3/E5, expect your renewal costs to rise.

On the plus side, you'll get more baked-in security features and access to Copilot capabilities that previously required add-ons. But it's a budget line item you'll want to plan for.

**So what?** Talk to your IT partner now about what's changing, what's included, and whether it makes sense to lock in current pricing before July. Factor the increase into your 2026 budget.

## TRENDS (Australia)

### 3) The National AI Plan is out — and mandatory guardrails are off the table (for now)

In December 2025, the Australian Government released its National AI Plan. The big shift: rather than introducing AI-specific legislation like the EU's AI Act, Australia will rely on existing technology-neutral laws and voluntary guidance.

The Plan is organised around three goals: capture the opportunities, spread the benefits to all Australians (including SMEs), and keep Australians safe. A new AI Safety Institute (with $29.9 million funding) will launch in early 2026 to assess upstream risks and support regulators.

**So what?** Don't expect prescriptive rules. Do expect regulators to ask how you're governing AI. The practical step remains unchanged: have a one-page policy, define data rules, document human-review points, and revisit quarterly.

### 4) Privacy law changes are coming — automated decisions require disclosure

The Privacy and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 2024 passed parliament in December. Starting December 2026, privacy policies must disclose information about substantially automated decisions that significantly affect individuals.

**So what?** If you're using AI to make decisions about customers, staff, or suppliers (credit checks, hiring screening, service eligibility), you'll need to document what's automated and how it works. Start mapping this now.

### 5) The workforce shift is real — but mass layoffs aren't

KPMG found 64% of organisations have already altered entry-level hiring due to AI (up from 18% last quarter). But Unisys and others predict mass layoffs won't materialise — instead, productivity gains will redirect to backlog reduction, customer experience, and modernisation.

The real shift? Entry-level roles are changing as AI handles routine work. The differentiator for teams is now effective human-AI collaboration, not basic adoption.

**So what?** Review your onboarding and training programs. The skills that matter in 2026 are prompting, reviewing AI outputs, and knowing when to override. Position AI upskilling as a retention and productivity play, not a cost-cutting exercise.

## Want help turning this into a 90-day plan?

If you saw yourself in any of the items above, we can map where to start: which assistants to enable, which workflows to standardise, and what policy and training to put in place so adoption sticks. We'll turn that into a simple 90-day plan your team can execute — and we'll stay on call as features roll out.
