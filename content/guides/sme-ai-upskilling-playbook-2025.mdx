## Introduction

AI use in the workplace has passed the novelty stage. Global surveys in early 2025 show employees are already using AI and, importantly, they want more formal training to do it properly — nearly half said training is the single best lever to boost AI adoption. At the same time, Australian data continues to show a gap between large organisations and smaller businesses on AI readiness, governance and skills — bigger firms are pulling ahead, while micro and small enterprises still cite "insufficient internal skills and knowledge" as a top barrier.

This playbook is written for Australian SMEs that can see the upside of AI but don't have a spare strategy team, a full L&D function, or months to design programs. It sets out a practical, 2025-ready approach to upskilling: light enough to run alongside business-as-usual, structured enough to create consistent, safe AI use.

> Australian workers expect more structured training and incentives to keep up with the pace of innovation, but employers and governments have yet to deliver at scale.

## 1. Why AI upskilling is now urgent for SMEs

Three forces are converging in 2025, and I see them play out in every client conversation:

**Employee pull.** Your people are already bringing AI into work. In some studies, more than half of employees admit they use AI tools and hide it from managers because there are no clear guidelines. Only 47% say they've received any formal AI training. That's both a risk and an opportunity.

**Capability gap.** Only 41% of Australian workers say their workplace is prepared for AI—below the global average. SMEs in particular report that lack of training and lack of internal skills are the main reasons they can't get AI working.

**Business ambition.** By late 2024, almost half of technology leaders globally said AI was "fully integrated" into business strategy. Your competitors are expecting AI-level speed and productivity. If you're not training your team, you're falling behind.

Put simply: employees want AI, leadership needs AI, but training hasn't caught up. That's exactly what an SME-level upskilling program should solve.

## 2. Principles for SME AI upskilling in 2025

After working with SMEs across different sectors over the past year and a half, here are the principles that actually work:

### a. Make it business-first

Training must start from the work people already do—service replies, finance narratives, ops handovers—not from generic AI features. I've seen too many "Introduction to AI" sessions that leave people inspired but with no idea what to do on Monday morning.

Start with the task. Show people how AI helps them do that task better. Then explain the technology.

### b. Train the whole stack, not only frontline

The 2025 research is clear: the biggest barrier to AI success is leadership, not employees. If executives don't have a shared view of where AI fits and what's safe, staff will stay cautious or go rogue.

Train leaders first. Get them aligned on what you're prioritising, what's approved, and what governance looks like. Then cascade to managers and teams.

### c. Keep governance lightweight

Trust in AI remains an issue—over half of people globally are still unwilling to fully trust AI, and many staff don't check AI outputs for accuracy.

Your training has to include red/amber/green data rules and human-in-the-loop checks. Make it simple. One page. People need to know what's safe and what's not before they start experimenting.

### d. Layer, don't flood

SMEs can't pull 50 people off the floor for two days. Use short, repeatable sessions and refresh them quarterly as tools change. The organisations getting this right are using micro-learning formats that fit around actual work.

## 3. The 2025 SME AI Upskilling Playbook (4 phases)

Here's the approach I've refined over the past 18 months with Australian SMEs. It's designed to take 8 weeks from start to finish, with most of the heavy lifting in the first month.

### Phase 1 — Align leadership (weeks 1–2)

**Objective:** Create a shared, business-first view of AI across your executive team.

I start every engagement here because if your leadership team isn't aligned, nothing else sticks. Employees pick up on mixed messages immediately.

**What to cover:**
- What AI/GenAI is and isn't (no jargon, just what matters for your business)
- Where AI is already delivering value in Australian sectors
- Top 5 risks for SMEs: data leakage, accuracy, IP loss, shadow AI, and change fatigue
- Your organisation's 2–3 AI priorities for the next 90 days
- Approval of a one-page AI policy

This directly addresses a pattern in the 2025 data: employees are ready to use AI, but leadership hasn't provided enough direction.

**Output:** A short AI position statement, list of approved tools, and red/amber/green data rules that everyone can understand.

### Phase 2 — Build core literacy (weeks 2–4)

**Objective:** Ensure everybody knows what's allowed and how to get a good AI output.

**Audience:** All staff who use a computer.

**Format:** 45–60 minute live or recorded session.

This is your foundation layer. Don't skip it. In my experience, the organisations that jump straight to "advanced use cases" end up with inconsistent quality and data incidents.

**Content to include:**
- Foundations — AI vs ML vs GenAI, 2025 tool landscape (keep it brief)
- Our approved tools and where to find them
- "Golden prompt" pattern — context → task → constraints → format → review
- Your R/A/G data rules and what to do if something goes wrong
- 2–3 internal examples from your own business

Why this matters: only 6% of employees feel "very comfortable" using AI in their role, even though most have tried it. They want clarity first.

### Phase 3 — Role- and function-based enablement (weeks 4–8)

This is where most SMEs stop planning—but 2025 surveys show staff want formal training and access to real tools, not just a demo.

After running dozens of these sessions, here's what works:

**Approach:**
- Pick your high-usage functions: services/CX, finance/admin, operations
- For each function, document 3–5 AI-enabled workflows
- Create role-based prompt packs (templates they can copy and customize)
- Show staff how to review AI outputs for that specific function

**Examples of what this looks like:**
- Services: Call summary → next actions → CRM note
- Finance: Monthly variance narrative → exec summary → board note
- Ops: SOP draft → QA → publish to knowledge base

The key is making it immediately applicable. People should walk out of the session and use AI the same afternoon.

This aligns with 2025 reports showing that finance, business, and operations workers are already using general-purpose tools and want sector-relevant training.

### Phase 4 — Sustain and measure (ongoing)

Upskilling can't be a one-and-done. AI is changing continuously, which means your training has to refresh continuously. Nearly 90% of organisations surveyed in 2025 said they'd require new technology skills in the next 12 months.

**Sustain with:**
- Monthly "AI wins" show-and-tell (5–10 mins in team meetings)
- Quarterly policy/tool refresh (new features, updated rules)
- Simple request channel for new use cases
- Short micro-learnings on new features (2–3 mins, video or email)

**Measure with:**
- % of staff who've attended AI literacy training
- Number of AI-enabled workflows documented
- Reduction in time-to-produce for targeted tasks
- Policy adherence (e.g., % using approved tools)
- Manager confidence ratings

If you're not measuring, you won't know if training is landing. The organisations that take this seriously are 32% more likely to be deploying AI training successfully.

## 4. Content map for 2025

To make this real, you don't need a giant curriculum. SMEs can build a narrow content library that covers most needs.

Here are the 10 pieces I recommend:
1. AI foundations for our business (slide deck or video)
2. Approved AI tools and how to access them
3. One-page AI policy + R/A/G data rules
4. Prompt guide (with business examples)
5. Services/CX use-case pack
6. Finance/admin use-case pack
7. Ops/SOP use-case pack
8. Reviewing AI outputs (checklist)
9. Requesting a new AI workflow (simple form)
10. Quarterly "What's new in AI for us" update

These 10 pieces will get you 80% of the way there. You can build them over 4–6 weeks and refine them as you go.

This approach directly addresses a concerning finding from KPMG and University of Melbourne: 66% of employees do not evaluate AI outputs for accuracy. Your "reviewing AI outputs" checklist is critical.

## 5. Addressing trust, fear, and shadow AI

Several 2025 studies show an interesting contradiction I see play out constantly: employees want AI training, but many are worried about being left behind or even losing their jobs.

46% of employees in organisations undergoing AI-driven redesign expressed job security concerns, and over half of people globally still don't fully trust AI.

You have to name this in your training. Don't pretend the fear isn't real.

Here's what I recommend SMEs do:

**Be explicit about the goal.** Explain that AI is there to remove low-value work (the repetitive, boring stuff), not to replace performance standards or people. Frame it as "here's how you'll spend more time on the parts of your job that actually matter."

**Show the upside for individuals.** AI skills are already attracting higher wages in Australia—workers who upskill see an 8–12% wage uplift. People want to know what's in it for them.

**Be transparent about automation plans.** Tell people what is and isn't being automated in the next 6–12 months. Uncertainty is worse than bad news.

**Recognize and reward AI-enabled improvements.** People want recognition, not just access to tools. When someone finds a better way to do something with AI, call it out.

This also pulls shadow AI into the open. Employees stop hiding AI use when they have training, policy, and recognition.

## 6. Who should own AI upskilling?

SMEs don't need a separate AI academy or a full-time AI training manager. Ownership can be light.

Here's the structure I've seen work best:

**Sponsor:** CEO/GM/COO — sets direction, signs off the policy, and makes it clear this matters

**Owner/steward:** Operations, strategy, or digital lead — coordinates sessions, keeps content current, runs the quarterly reviews

**Function champions:** Service, finance, ops leads — capture and improve the actual workflows, coach their teams

This aligns with Australian findings that AI projects are often delivered through several service providers and internal champions because skills are scarce. A named steward keeps it coherent.

You don't need a big team. You need clear ownership.

## 7. When to partner

Most SMEs I work with can handle some of this internally—but rarely all of it.

Here's where external help typically makes sense:
- Getting leadership aligned (Phase 1) — running the executive session, drafting the one-page AI policy, and setting priorities
- Delivering executive and team training (Phases 2–3) — the foundational sessions and role-based workshops that build capability across your organisation
- Designing role-based prompt packs for your key functions
- Setting up the measurement framework so you know what's working

That's the work The AI Guides was created to do—translating fast-moving AI into right-sized, business-first training for Australian SMEs. We design and deliver the program, then hand it to your team to sustain.

## Key takeaways

- Employees are ahead of many employers on AI, but they're under-trained—only ~47% report any formal AI training, yet usage is high
- Australian SMEs specifically cite lack of internal skills as a leading barrier; upskilling is a growth enabler, not just compliance
- A four-phase approach—align leadership, build literacy, enable by role, sustain and measure—is realistic to deliver inside an SME in 8 weeks
- Governance must be taught with the skills, or shadow AI and data risk will rise
- Continuous refresh is essential because AI capability and employee expectations are both moving quickly

## Next Steps

The SMEs that are pulling ahead in 2025 aren't the ones with the biggest AI budgets—they're the ones that trained their people early and gave them clear guardrails.

If you're ready to move from "our people are experimenting" to "our people have a system," here's where to start:

### 1. Assess your current state

Before you design training, figure out where you actually are. Some people are power users. Others have never touched a generative AI tool.

[Take our 5-minute AI Readiness Survey →](/ai-readiness-survey)

You'll get an instant snapshot of your organisation's preparedness across people, processes, and data, plus the 3–5 actions to take in the next 30 days.

### 2. Get your leadership aligned

The biggest barrier to AI success isn't your team—it's getting your executive team on the same page about what you're prioritising, what's safe, and what training looks like.
