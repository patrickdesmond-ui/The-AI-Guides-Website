Most of the SMEs I speak with are in the same position: they know AI is important, they've seen a few good demos, staff are already using tools quietly — but there's no single view of "what are we actually doing with AI this year?" That's all an AI strategy is at SME level: a clear, short plan that says why we're doing this, where we'll start, and how we'll keep it safe. It doesn't need to be a 50-page deck.

Let me walk through what I'd include, who should own it, and where we (The AI Guides) can help.

## Why SMEs need an AI strategy (and not just experimentation)

There are three reasons.

**AI is arriving faster than your people can process.** Without a strategy, everyone runs their own experiments, and you can't tell what's working.

**Risk rises quietly.** People paste real customer data into public tools because no one told them not to.

**You can only do 2–3 things at once.** Strategy is mostly about choosing those 2–3 things.

So the point of a strategy is focus and permission: "These are the AI things we are doing, these are the ones we are not doing yet, and here's how to use AI safely."

## What an SME AI strategy should contain

You can build a perfectly good AI strategy for a mid-sized Australian business with five parts:

### 1. Business goals

One paragraph. "We're using AI to improve service speed, reduce admin in finance, and help managers communicate." Tie it to outcomes your team already cares about.

### 2. Priority use-cases (2–3 only)

This is the heart. Example:
- Customer/service emails and summaries
- Finance narratives and AR replies
- SOP creation for ops

Pick things that are repeatable and that staff already do.

### 3. People and training

A line that says: "We will train execs/managers/staff in this order" and "these are the approved tools." Strategy without training stalls.

### 4. Data and tools

List the systems you already use (M365 / Google / CRM) and the AI features you will switch on first. Prefer what you already own.

### 5. Governance and cadence

Link to your one-page AI policy with red/amber/green data rules, and say "we review AI monthly in ELT." This is what keeps it alive.

If you have those five, you have a strategy.

## Who should own AI strategy?

In an SME, this should not be thrown at IT alone — they'll do a good job on tools and security, but the value sits in the business.

Best setup I've seen:

**Sponsor:** CEO/GM/COO — owns the "why" and approves the focus areas.

**Steward:** someone in ops/strategy/transformation — keeps the roadmap up to date, runs the reviews, talks to vendors.

**Process owners:** finance, service, ops — each owns their AI-enabled workflows.

If you have those three roles, you don't need an AI department.

## How we would work with you on it

When we do this with clients, we keep it short and practical:

**Discovery (1–2 conversations):** what are you trying to fix, which teams, what tools you have now.

**Use-case sprint:** we map 6–8 ideas, score them, and keep the best 2–3.

**Guardrails:** we draft the one-page AI policy so staff know what's allowed.

**90-day plan:** we line up training, comms, and a simple dashboard.

You get something you can actually show the exec team, not an abstract framework.

## Key takeaways

- You don't need a big-firm AI strategy — you need a short, shared one.
- Start with the work people already do (service, finance, ops).
- Train early, so people stop guessing.
- Write down your data rules.
- Review monthly; AI changes too fast for "set and forget."

If you want a hand drafting the first version, or you want us to run the use-case sprint with your leadership team, reach out — this is exactly what The AI Guides was set up to do. [Contact us today](/contact).
