Your roadmap for building internal AI capability—covering skills, training pathways, and upskilling best practices for Australian SMEs.

## Why Upskilling Matters Now

The window for AI skill development is narrowing. Organisations that build AI capability now will have a significant advantage as the technology matures. Here's your practical guide to making it happen.

## The SME Upskilling Framework

### Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-4)

**Objective:** Establish baseline understanding across the organisation

- Tool selection and setup

**Outcomes:**
- Shared vocabulary and understanding
- Clear governance framework
- Approved tools accessible to all

### Phase 2: Application (Weeks 5-8)

**Objective:** Build practical skills in priority functions

**Activities:**
- Function-specific workshops (2-3 hours each)
- Use case identification and documentation
- Hands-on practice sessions
- Peer support groups established

**Outcomes:**
- Teams actively using AI in daily work
- Documented use cases and prompts
- Growing confidence with tools

### Phase 3: Acceleration (Weeks 9-12)

**Objective:** Embed AI into standard processes and develop internal champions

**Activities:**

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **Starting without leadership alignment**—AI adoption stalls without visible leadership support

2. **Training without practice time**—Skills need immediate application to stick

3. **Ignoring governance**—Ungoverned AI use creates risk and anxiety

4. **One-size-fits-all training**—Different roles need different skills

5. **Stopping after initial training**—AI capability needs ongoing development
