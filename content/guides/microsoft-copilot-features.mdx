Most teams have Microsoft Copilot licenses sitting unused. Here are the four features that solve real problems—and how to start using them this week.

I had a conversation last week with an SME client who's been using Microsoft 365 for years. They'd rolled out Copilot licenses across the leadership team six months ago. When I asked how it was going, the answer was telling: "Honestly? I think we've used it twice."

This is more common than you'd think. The problem isn't the technology—it's knowing where to start. So here are the four Copilot features I recommend SMEs actually focus on.

## 1. Meeting Summaries in Teams

If your team spends significant time in meetings, this is the highest-value starting point. Copilot can:

- Generate meeting summaries automatically
- Extract action items with owners
- Answer questions about what was discussed

**How to start:** Enable Copilot for your next recurring team meeting and review the summary together afterwards.

## 2. Email Drafting in Outlook

For leaders who spend hours on email, Copilot can draft responses based on context from the thread and your previous communications.

**How to start:** Use Copilot to draft your next three longer email responses, then refine as needed.

## 3. Document Summarisation

Need to review a long report, policy document, or contract? Copilot can summarise key points and answer specific questions about the content.

**How to start:** Upload a document you've been putting off reading and ask Copilot to summarise the key points.

## 4. Excel Data Analysis

For teams working with data, Copilot can analyse spreadsheets, create visualisations, and answer questions about your data in natural language.

**How to start:** Open a data-heavy spreadsheet and ask Copilot "What are the key trends in this data?"

## The Key to Adoption

The common thread here is starting with a specific use case, not trying to use Copilot for everything at once. Pick one feature, use it consistently for two weeks, then add another.
