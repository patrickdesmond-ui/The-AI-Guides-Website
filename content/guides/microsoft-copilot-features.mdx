Most teams have Microsoft Copilot licenses sitting unused. Here are the four features that solve real problems—and how to start using them this week.

I had a conversation last week with an SME client who's been using Microsoft 365 for years. They'd heard about Copilot, paid for the licenses, but when I asked what they were actually using, they said: "Honestly? We're not sure what half of it does."

Fair enough. Microsoft ships updates faster than most of us can keep up. So here are four Microsoft 365 Copilot features that rolled out recently that Australian SMEs should actually know about.

## 1. Copilot Chat sits inside your actual apps now

This one sounds boring but it's not. Copilot Chat is now embedded directly in Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook, and OneNote.

Translation: you don't need to open a separate AI tool, paste content in, then paste the answer back. You ask Copilot a question about the open spreadsheet or email and it just answers—right there. It already knows what you're working on.

**Why it matters for SMEs:** your finance person can ask "what's driving the biggest variance here?" without leaving Excel. Your BD team can ask "summarise this proposal" without switching apps. Less friction = more adoption.

## 2. It can finally handle massive documents

Microsoft upgraded Copilot with expanded document handling—you can now work with documents up to around 300 pages ([Microsoft 365 Copilot documentation](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/copilot)). In practical terms, you can throw a lengthy tender document at it and it'll actually read the whole thing.

Before this, most AI tools would choke or skip sections. Now you can upload board papers, contracts, compliance docs, whatever—and ask for proper summaries or specific clauses.

**Why it matters for SMEs:** if you're in professional services, construction, or any sector drowning in PDFs, this is huge. No more "I think the liability clause was on page 87."

## 3. Search results that actually tell you what's relevant

Microsoft rolled out something called "AI Views" in Copilot Search. Instead of giving you ten file names and hoping you guess which one is useful, it shows you a mini summary, who last worked on it, related files, and what you might want to do next.

Think of it like search results with built-in triage.

**Why it matters for SMEs:** your team spends less time hunting for the right version of the customer proposal or the updated org chart. Copilot just tells you "here's the latest one, last edited yesterday by Sarah, and here's the older version for reference."

## 4. It can read charts and diagrams in your files

Copilot now understands images inside PDFs, Word docs, and PowerPoints. Upload a file, point to a specific page, and ask "what's this chart showing?" or "what model is in this diagram?" and it'll actually answer.

Before this, AI could read text but images were a black box.

**Why it matters for SMEs:** if you're reviewing technical specs, site plans, or financial dashboards, you don't need to manually interpret every chart. Copilot does the first pass for you.

## What to do with this

Pick one feature above that solves a problem your team has this week. Test it with two people. If it works, document the workflow and share it.

Don't try to roll out all four at once. Just find the one quick win that saves someone 30 minutes and makes them look good in front of their manager. That's how adoption starts.

If you want help building a proper Copilot adoption plan for your team—prompt libraries, safe use policies, role-based training—[let's talk](/contact).

Cheers,
Patrick
