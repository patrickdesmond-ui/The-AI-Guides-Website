A lot of AI conversations get stuck at "we should train people." That's true, but what most Australian SMEs actually need is a way to keep people learning as AI changes—without blowing up everyone's calendar.

Here's a practical framework for building AI skills that actually sticks.


## The Three Layers of AI Skills


### Layer 1: AI Literacy (Everyone)

Every person in your organisation needs basic AI literacy:

- Understanding what AI can and can't do
- Recognising AI-generated content
- Knowing your organisation's AI policy
- Basic security and privacy awareness

**How to build it:** A 90-minute session plus ongoing micro-learning through regular updates and examples.


### Layer 2: AI Application (Role-specific)

People who can use AI in their daily work:

- Using AI tools relevant to their function
- Writing effective prompts
- Reviewing and improving AI outputs
- Knowing when AI is and isn't appropriate

**How to build it:** Role-specific workshops (2-4 hours) plus guided practice over 2-3 weeks.


### Layer 3: AI Fluency (Champions)

A smaller group who can lead AI adoption:

- Identifying new use cases
- Training and supporting colleagues
- Evaluating new tools
- Contributing to AI policy and governance

**How to build it:** Extended program (4-8 weeks) with project work and mentoring.


## The Common Mistakes


### Mistake 1: Training Everyone the Same Way

Different roles need different skills. Your finance team's AI use cases differ from your customer service team's.


### Mistake 2: One-off Training

AI is changing constantly. A single training session becomes outdated quickly. Build in ongoing learning.


### Mistake 3: No Practice Time

People need protected time to experiment with AI tools. Training without practice doesn't translate to actual capability.


### Mistake 4: Skipping Leadership

If leaders don't understand and use AI, teams won't either. Start training at the top.


## A Practical Rollout Sequence

1. **Week 1-2:** Leadership briefing and alignment
2. **Week 3-4:** Establish AI policy and approved tools
3. **Week 5-6:** Role-specific training for priority functions
4. **Week 7-8:** Champion development and peer support setup
5. **Ongoing:** Regular updates, new use case sharing, policy refinement


## Measuring Progress

Track metrics that matter:

- **Adoption:** How many people are actively using AI tools?
- **Quality:** Is work output improving?
- **Efficiency:** Are tasks taking less time?
- **Confidence:** Do people feel capable with AI?
